        <h1>Our Path</h1>
        <p>Our company has gone through a long and difficult path to reach its current position.</p>

                    "Some peope dream of success, while other people get up every morning and make it happen - Thomas Edison".
                    
                    That is why the most difficult idea was to implement and bring it to fruition,
                     but the main thing is dilligence and determination, these are the qualities
                      that make a person successful.

                <h3>Failure</h3>
                <p>
                    Our company experienced a number of failures both in the beginning and in the development process,
                     such as product failure, excess quantity and so on, but none of this stopped the founders.

                <h3>Success</h3>
                <p>
                    When our company was on the verge of collapse and had no chance of development, 
                    we decided to finally end this era and retire from this business, but at that time an
                     investor appeared who completely changed everything and helped the company to be at the
                      level of development it is now
